# BlueKit2D: A 2D Game Engine
## Overview

BlueKit2D is a lightweight, extensible 2D game engine designed to provide a robust foundation for game developers. Built with C++, the engine focuses on performance, modularity, and ease of use.
Features

- **Entity-Component-System Architecture:** Efficiently manage game objects and behaviors.
- **Physics System:** Includes basic collision detection and physics simulations.
- **Sprite System:** Easily manage and render 2D sprites.
- **Scene Management:** Organize game states and transitions.
- **Modular Components:** Extend the engine with custom components and systems.

## Getting Started

To create a new game, I would reccomend starting with the TestGame Files to learn.
I do intend on writing a guide one day, but hopefully until then the example is there to guide.

# Build
Clone the repo, then make a build directory and cd into it and run
```zsh
cmake ..
make
../TestGame/Game
```
Alternatively open the project in CLion and build all
